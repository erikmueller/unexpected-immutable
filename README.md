> Assert (pretty) equality of Immutable.js iterables with unexpected.

## Why the ...?

As long as nothing goes wrong, unexpected can pretty much take care of this assertion itself. Just when it comes to diffing the immutable data structure things get a little ugly.

## Very little purpose

So all this (very) small plugin does is converting the structure to JSON, checking the type and giving you a slightly nicer diff.

Feel free to rant, criticize and contribute. :)
